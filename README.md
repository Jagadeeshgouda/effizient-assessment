The project entails developing a web-based user interface (UI) that mirrors the functionality of an existing Google Form-based SOP Generation Tool. Users can input information into the UI, which is then sent to the backend. Subsequently, an email is automatically generated and dispatched to the user's provided email address, containing a customized Statement of Purpose based on the data entered in the UI.# effizient-assessment
